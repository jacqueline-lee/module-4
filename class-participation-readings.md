Evidence I have participated in class and engaged with course readings:

### Class Participation
Participation in class exploration of ways we could execute Module 4 - I used the Generominos provided to create the digital artefact for my Module 4 project, evidenced by me in the picture in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/electricarchaeo/status/979037414084689921) by Professor Graham.

Participation in class discussion, especially on April 2 and April 4, contributing to discussion about what my classmates and I learned from the course and how the class could be improved, respectively. Evidenced by the photos Professor Graham took of the board that I don't have, plus [the google doc that we collaborated on in class that I don't have access to anymore](https://bit.ly/3812-exit-ticket). Also, me being snarky in class being [documented on twitter](https://twitter.com/electricarchaeo/status/981571711098220545) by Professor Graham and myself (in a responding tweet).
