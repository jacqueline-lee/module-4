We were told we could create our own marking scheme, so I have done so here:

5 points for class participation and course readings  
Rationale: Making comments, asking questions, and answer professor questions stops me from making substantial class notes the way I normally would during a normal lecture. For many of the classes during this module my notes were sparse due to the very short period the module spanned, as well as the in-depth discussions we had in class.

5 points for digital artefact (Generominos: Theoretical generative methods system)  
Rationale: Throughout the course we have been repeatedly told that the emphasis in this course is on the process and not the product or outcome of our projects. However, I still think the creation of an artefact is important and integral to these modules - otherwise we would have nothing to document and discuss in our process notes and paradata.

10 points for process notes and paradata  
Rationale: Because this is where the course focuses on, I think this is where the most marks should fall. I combined these two because it made the most sense for me to document them together - creating documentation of what I did when, but also logging the reasoning behind my decision making at the same time. I hope that combining my process notes and paradata together in one document makes it easier to understand the process I underwent to create my Module 4 project.
